The creator was saying that businesses have the right to refuse service to anyone they want, and it was wrapped up in this homophobic rhetoric disguised as 'common sense' or religious beliefs. The video blew up with tons of likes and comments, and it made me feel really sad and scared. I'm not out to my family yet, so seeing something like that made me worry about my future and whether I can ever have a normal life. I didn't comment or like the post, but it's been stuck in my head ever since. The worst part was seeing how many people agreed with the creator and praised him. It made me feel so lonely, like no one in the world would ever accept me.",This happened on WhatsApp. I had just written an exam for my medical university module. The group chat on WhatsApp consisted of everyone in my year. After everyone got their results people started comparing them to each other on the group chat. This one person who got top marks said everyone should be getting top marks and if they’re not then they are stupid. I go t relatively high marks but not top marks so the post just made me feel very bad about myself when I know I should have been proud. I didn’t post anything but I felt I should’ve to defend myself and others alike.

There was a terrorist incident in Manchester where someone was caught trying to hurt people. In the aftermath, someone posted a really hateful, islamophobic message. It was deeply upsetting to see my community, which is mostly moderate and law-abiding, being unfairly blamed for something we had nothing to do with and would never support. What made it even worse was that the post stayed up for an entire week, and Facebook did nothing to remove it. It was really disheartening to see such negativity and hate being allowed to spread unchecked. I reported the post multiple times, hoping that it would be taken down quickly, but each time I checked, it was still there. The comments section was filled with even more hate speech and misinformation, which only added to the distress. Friends and family members who saw the post were also deeply affected, and it sparked a lot of anxiety and fear within our community. We felt helpless and vulnerable, knowing that such harmful content could be shared so easily and remain visible for so long. This experience has made me more cautious about using social media and has highlighted the need for better moderation and quicker responses to harmful content.","I was browsing through facebook one day where there was a post about how south asian people in the United Kingdom were very crime ridden and how the muslim subgroup of the south asian population were more prone to crime and terrorism and that they were eroding british culture. The context of the situation was that this occured during the riots that stemmed from the stabbing in Southport by a black man, which had nothing to do with south asians or muslims. The situation made me quite depressed as I was being vilified for something I did not even do, I try my best to integrate into British society.

The worst part of it all was feeling like I had betrayed my friend by staying silent. It really sucked.","One of my friends was having a party and I had invited 3 of my others friends to go. However, one of these friends had made out with a girl at a previous party that I had invited them to, and her ex boyfriend was also going to be at this party. He found out and messaged my friend who was hosting the party telling him that he was not going to go unless the guy who had made out with his ex-girlfriend was un-invited from the party. I then had to tell my friend that he wasn't allowed to come to the party. I felt like an injustice had been done and also that the situation would have been handled much better in person rather than through group chats on social media. I reacted by apologising to the guy who couldn't come and also telling my other friends what had happened. The worst part was that I felt as if I had to tell my friend that he couldn't come, which felt like I was backtracking on what I had told him previously."

It was a really tough thing to witness and made me question a lot about humanity.","I saw a video of a black man in Virginia City, Nevada, being racially harassed by a white man on TikTok. I can't remember exactly what was said but the white man said something along the lines of 'black people were hung from trees in my backyard', and the others watching along just laughed with him. After a couple minutes a white lady comes and starts gently pushing him - trying to get him to leave - while saying in a patronising tone ""god loves you"", and ""oh my god, I'm so sorry"" in a dismissive tone as the black man tries to explain what happened. Towards the end of the video the black man audibly starts to break down.

I felt so upset and angry, wondering why I couldn't be as lucky—why I wasn't pretty enough to earn money and fame just by looking good. The worst part was that I was in the middle of job hunting, sending out applications left and right, only to get rejected over and over. Seeing these influencers living their best lives while I couldn't even land a job was just soul-crushing.","I have had social media for quite some time. Sometimes I scroll through comments on posts, particularly pictures that girls post to see what kind of things people are saying. It shocks me to see men commenting inappropriate things underneath these girls posts, commenting on their looks, their bodies etc. Sometimes the girls who post the pictures encourage this by accepting money from these men to post more revealing pictures of themselves. It makes me upset to think that some girls turn to exposing their bodies to make money."

She started exposing people's personal information just because they disagreed with her. The whole thing started because people were upset that she was charging her mostly young fans to enter a giveaway, which felt really unfair and exploitative. I thought her reaction was super immature because it's never okay to put someone's private info out there and put them at risk like that. The worst part? She did all this on a huge platform and didn't face any consequences for it. It was really messed up.","I currently keep up with a Kpop group called NCT 127. Recently it was found that one of the members had been kicked out of the group as he committed a sex crime. The police released a statement explaining how they did not want to disclose specific details about the situation, to protect the victim's identity. Unfortunately, many Kpop fans took this situation as an opportunity to spread misinformation on social media. They did this by editing fake screenshots of messages and simply just lying. The situation made me realise how gullible people can be, especially when my friends sent me posts containing false information  while whole-heartedly believing them. I felt very frustrated and upset for the victim because it must have been hard for her to come forward and share her story, considering how the ex-group member was so well-known and had many supporters, yet people were totally disempowering her by making up lies. I was also angry that many Kpop fans were disregarding her and turning the situation into a fanwar and using the situation as a ""gotcha"" moment to make fun of fans who supported the criminal, not knowing who he truly was. I decided to take a step back from social media as it was extremely upsetting seeing such a serious situation being spoke discussed in such a way."

The fake account sent me messages saying that im a creep, i couldnt believe that the person behind the account could be this evil to pretend to be someone else just to trouble me. it made me very angry and upset that someone could do something like this to me when I didnt deserve it."

I ended up feeling really annoyed and just gave up on reading the conversation.","when i was scrolling through instagram reels one day, there was a trend called the photoflash challenge or something similar where someone would play a video of a normal photo and then for a single flame flash a different image which was something usually pornographic. the challenge didn't bother me much but it was concerning thing about how many children are on instagram and would be exposed to this, i tried reporting the images but most were unsuccessful as the image was visible for too short of a time to detect, or they were abusing educational exceptions so it was not counted as porn (the captions would say something about sex ed), it justt felt very shocking that it was not cracked down on more"

The post was about a controversial decision made by a referee during a big game, and I thought my opinion was pretty solid. I mentioned that while the referee's call was questionable, the players should have maintained their sportsmanship. My comment actually got a lot of likes, which made me feel pretty good about sharing my thoughts. But then, I started getting these comments that were kinda critical and dismissive. Some people were saying I didn't know what I was talking about, and others were just plain rude. At first, it bummed me out a bit, but I managed to shrug it off pretty quickly. The worst part, though, was just how mean people were for no reason. It made me realize how harsh people can be online, even when you're just trying to share your thoughts.","I once made a small mistake on a video I created and it made me very annoyed because I knew people would call me up on it.

There's this trend on TikTok where the first image shows an 'unattractive' hooked nose with captions like 'imagine having this nose...' and then you swipe to see a flawless, tiny button nose. It's omnipresent on my feed. I spend a lot of time on social media, and it's nearly impossible not to get ensnared by these beauty standards. It's like, every time I try to take a break and scroll through TikTok, I encounter these posts that make me question my own features. It makes me feel insecure and ashamed. But then I think about my home country and its rich, unique culture, and I try to remind myself that beauty isn't one-size-fits-all. The worst part is, you can't escape it. Even when you're just trying to unwind, there's always some post comparing or criticizing a specific feature. It's utterly exhausting.","I spend over 4 hours on social media scrolling on a daily basis. Occasionally, I've come across bizarre posts that provoke certain beliefs, colours, and ethnicities. but especially appearances and meeting the western beauty standards. Personally, I don't have a slim pointy nose, nor a smooth complexion with light skin. I have rather thick eyebrows and more masculine features despite being a female. A trend that I've seen on tiktok constantly was people saying 'imagine having a hooked or crooked nose' then you slide to the next picture and see a beautul button nose with a small slope. In the comments, I see people hating on different nose structures and face shapes from specific demographics. It's a shame to not feel pretty and have the urge to do surgery just to look like the other girls. It messes with your confidence and self-esteem. From day-to-day, I have the urge to change how people could perceive me or how I should perceive myself. It's a battle within yourself to want to feel accepted. The worse part of the situation is how young children from the ages 11 start asking their parents for surgery to 'perfect' a feature of their face. If these comparisons make people like myself feel inferior about my uniqueness, you could imagine how hurt the younger generations would feel. "

It was a Saturday night, we were both in a Instagram group chat with dozens of other people from across our year group. We were arguing and talking smack to each other. I don't remember the exact precise details but some people were instigating us to just fight it out after school. Of course, due to peer pressure I initially accepted because I didn't really doubt I would win. He was by no means a scary, tough kid. Nonetheless, after arguing and talking smack in the Instagram group chat for 30 minutes or so, for reasons still unclear to me, I decided to let my parents know. As one might expect they were extremely unhappy and thoroughly talked me out of doing it.

I decided to go back to the group chat after publicly accepting that the fight would happen to instead announce something along the lines that I would basically pull out of the fight and instead report him to the school and have him expelled for bullying or harassment and proposing a fight. You can imagine how that looked on my behalf. Like I said, the kid was not tough or scary but it looked like I was scared of him. I thought it was a good approach to avoid the fight and still win in this other way, but everyone saw it as cowardice, including the kid in question.

I of course received countless messages with personal attacks after that. Not just that but the following Monday we were obviously back in school. As one might expect people didn't easily forget and made it into a whole big deal for the entire rest of the year, bringing it up either in real life or on social media.

This wasn't the first time this person had posted something like this; just last week, they had another tweet blow up with thousands of likes and retweets from big accounts. I guess they thought they could replicate that success, but this time it just came off as weird and out of touch. I couldn't stay silent, so I decided to voice my thoughts. The whole situation was ridiculous to me. In today's world, it's almost impossible for a household to survive on a single income, especially with multiple people.

I got responses from people saying that I could always apply and the agency would filter me out if they thought I wasn't fit for the role. however, there was one user who mentioned that they were appalled by my behaviour and felt that I was just another disrespectful skinny girl who wanted to take opportunities away from plus-sized actors.

I'm trying to break free from this cycle and get back to content that truly resonates with who I am.","There was once a time where i was trying to conciously improve myself, and more specifically the way i interact with other people. I saw on one of my group chats that one of my friends had a question and was very persistent regarding it. My other friends were sending answers but he was not content with any of them. At first i decided to ignore the question and the chat altogether, but one day i thought that i could provide some general advice regarding the question. This lead to my friend misunderstanding what i was trying to convey, and rather feeling betrayed. At first they reacted harshly which caused my other friends to question his behaviour. This eventually caused a wave of agression to drown us all from the friend with the initial question. They chose to leave the group and cut off all contact with us all, despite efforts to reconciliate."

I felt really uneasy and disgusted knowing that people like this exist. I managed to stop the messages and reported the pages, but the worst part was realizing how easy it was for these fake accounts to interact with kids. It was a disturbing wake-up call about the dangers online. To prevent this from happening, it's important to educate children about the risks of interacting with strangers online and encourage them to report any suspicious activity. Parents should also monitor their children's online activity and use parental control tools to restrict access to certain sites. Social media platforms need to implement stricter verification processes and improve their reporting systems to quickly identify and remove fake accounts.","People in my school would create accounts to post our school fights which would give negative connotations about our school however it was something that all the students wanted to watch if they missed the fight live.

The messages included embarrassing things that I would never say and while most people believed me when I said they were fake, some people made fun of me and kept bringing it up making me feel uncomfortable for a while at school. It also made the girl uncomfortable as jokes were being made to her as well. I reacted by not bringing it up and not giving an entertaining reaction when someone else brought it up and eventually the situation fizzled out. The worst part of the situation was the awkwardness when I had to sit near the girl and her friends in biology."

There was this banlist called 'The Bad Space,' and the person who ran it used it to unfairly target minority groups. It was really hurtful and made a lot of people angry. When folks tried to speak up, their friends twisted the situation and accused them of being racist just because they were people of color. I was part of one of the biggest servers that got targeted, and even though I had nothing to do with the initial drama, I suddenly found myself in the middle of a huge flame war. It was really overwhelming. I ended up scrolling through way more posts than I should have, which just made me more upset. Eventually, I unfollowed a bunch of people who were talking about it and adjusted my blocked words to avoid seeing any more mentions of it. The worst part was feeling so angry and scared. This community was supposed to be a safe space, an alternative to all the problems of traditional social media, and now it felt like it was falling apart. I was really worried about the future of this space I liked so much.","I am a high-ranking staff member on a large Discord server for a minority group. I think the most challenging thing we've had was when we discovered a fellow member of our staff team was a pedophile.

It happens, every now and then: someone you trust being really not trustworthy, and it's not exactly *rare* for pedophiles to try to infiltrate our server - it having a lot of minors it's relatively ideal. However, the staff team of this Discord server is quite closely-knit - we have to trust each other to properly keep the server running - and it hit really hard on all of us. It hurt our trust in other people in the group, and made us less able to handle a difficult situation at a time when we really needed to be able to do a lot of things: report to law enforcement and platform trust & safety, warn other partner servers, field questions from our members, etc. Banning the person is really only ever the first step. I felt scared - I was scrambling to try to keep the situation under control but with a team that seemed to be falling apart at the edges."

What really got to me was that he had a cat, and it was clear that the poor cat couldn't possibly be happy in such conditions. I wanted to report it to help the cat, but I had no idea where to make a report. Seeing his videos of him smoking indoors and being extremely drunk regularly just made me feel so sad. I felt powerless, knowing there was nothing I could do to provide a better life for the cat. To this day, it still makes me very upset.
