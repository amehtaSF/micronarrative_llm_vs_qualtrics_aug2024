A group of people, who didn't even know her, started making horrible comments about her appearance. They said her features and body were disgusting and gross, and they picked on things like her nose and jaw for no reason at all. There wasn't any context or reason behind their cruelty; they just wanted to be mean. Seeing those comments made me feel disgusted and angry on her behalf. It was so emotional trying to help her through it because she got hurt really badly. The worst part was trying to make her feel better about herself, even though none of this was her fault.

There was no context, no backstory\u2014just pure meanness from people who didn't even know them.

My mom posted a picture of us in front of my new college's logo as we were moving in. It was supposed to be a happy moment, but things took a turn for the worse when one of my exes reposted the picture with a really hurtful caption, 'Good riddance faggot.' Seeing that made me feel bitter and angry, and I had this urge to get back at them somehow. But after thinking it over, I decided to stay silent because I knew escalating the situation wouldn't help. The hardest part was feeling helpless, like everyone only saw their side of the story because I chose not to respond. Even though it was probably the right decision, it still stung.",

It was supposed to be a happy moment, but then one of my exes saw it and decided to repost it with the caption 'Good riddance faggot.' That really stung. I felt bitter and wanted to get back at them somehow, but I knew it wouldn't help anything.

I was super bitter and wanted to clap back so bad, but I knew it wasn't worth the drama. The worst part? Feeling like everyone only saw his side because I chose to stay quiet. It sucked, but I knew keeping my cool was the smarter move.",

The content I come across is often so superficial and easy to consume that I find myself endlessly scrolling without even realizing it. This isn't just something that happens to me; it's a common issue that many people face, even if they don't consider themselves addicted to social media. When I catch myself in this cycle, I usually try to close the app and focus on something else, but it's tough not to get drawn back in. The worst part of this experience is the guilt I feel afterward. I can't help but think about all the productive things I could have done instead of wasting time on my phone. It's a frustrating habit that I'm trying to break.",
    "scenario_2": "Lately, I've been noticing how easy it is to get sucked into mindless scrolling on social media. The content is so superficial that it's effortless to just keep scrolling without even thinking about it. This isn't just a problem for people who are addicted to social media; it's something that can happen to anyone. Even if you don't consider yourself hooked, it's still easy to fall into this bad habit. When I catch myself doing this, I usually try to close the app and find something else to do. But honestly, it's tough not to go back to it later. The worst part is the guilt that comes with it. I end up feeling like I wasted my time and could have done something way more productive. It's a frustrating cycle.",
    "scenario_3": "So, here's the deal. Social media these days is like a bag of chips \u2013 no substance, just easy to munch on and keep scrolling. It's not just me; loads of people get sucked into this black hole, even if they're not full-blown addicts. I try to be good and shut the app down, maybe go do something actually useful, but it's like a magnet pulling me back. The worst part? That gnawing guilt, knowing I could've done something way more productive with my time. Ugh, it's a vicious cycle.",
