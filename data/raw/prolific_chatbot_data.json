It was just a typical football fan thing, you know? Some people agreed with me, but a lot of others didn't, and it turned into this huge argument in the comments. It wasn't like I knew any of these people; they were just random football fans on the internet. Anyway, it got pretty heated, and I felt really annoyed because no one was accepting my opinion. I kept arguing back, trying to prove my point. The worst part was feeling totally overwhelmed by so many people disagreeing with me at once. It felt like I lost the argument, and that really sucked.",
    "scenario_3": "So, I was scrolling through this football page on social media and saw a post about Messi. I couldn't resist, so I jumped into the comments to say why I think Messi is the greatest footballer alive. Pretty soon, I was in a full-blown argument with a bunch of random football fans. Some people agreed with me, but a lot of others didn't, and it turned into this massive back-and-forth. It wasn't anything serious, just your typical football debate, but it still got to me. I felt pretty frustrated because no one seemed to accept my opinion. I kept arguing, trying to prove my point, but the worst part was just feeling overwhelmed by so many people disagreeing with me at once. In the end, I felt like I lost the argument, and it left me feeling kinda defeated.",

Meanwhile, one of my friends kept posting all these amazing photos on social media about the places they visited and the fun things they did with other friends. Seeing those posts made me feel even worse. I felt super lonely and like I didn't have any friends who wanted to hang out with me. It was like everyone had their own plans and I was just left out. The worst part was thinking that maybe my friends didn't like me anymore because they never had time to text me, but I could see them having a great time without me on social media. It made me feel really isolated and sad.",

I felt ugly and embarrassed, like I wasn't as good as the other girls. I ended up deleting all my posts because I just couldn't handle it. Later, I found out that a lot of those pictures were edited, but in that moment, I felt really awful.",

I also set up filters for future comments to avoid going through the same experience again. The worst part was not knowing who these people were, as the comments came from anonymous accounts. It was a tough lesson, but I'm trying to protect myself better online now.",
    "scenario_3": "So, I had this really bad experience on TikTok recently. I posted a video and people started leaving negative comments about how I looked. It was just a rough hair day, but some people went out of their way to say I was unattractive. It made me feel really unsafe online, so I ended up deleting the post and removing all the rude comments. I even started filtering my comments from then on. The worst part was not knowing who these people were, like they were just random accounts. It was really unsettling.",

I felt pretty sad and lonely seeing the negative reactions, but I tried not to dwell on it too much since it was just a hot take.

This made me feel quite sad and lonely, but I tried not to dwell on it too much since it was just a hot take. The worst part was seeing people block me and express hate towards me because of my opinion. It was a harsh reminder of how quickly things can escalate online.",
    "scenario_3": "So, I was participating in this discussion thread about a video game, and I shared my 'hot take' on it. A lot of people didn't like my opinion, which was kinda expected since it was a controversial topic. I knew it was a hot take, but still, it made me feel pretty sad and lonely when I saw the reactions. I tried not to dwell on it too much because, at the end of the day, it's just a game and everyone has different opinions. But the worst part was seeing people block me and send hate my way just because of what I said. It really sucked to feel that kind of rejection over something so trivial.",

    "scenario_3": "Recently, I had an awkward moment that made me rethink my phone habits. I was having a casual chat with someone I care about while they were cooking in the kitchen. I was sitting on the couch, and before I knew it, I had completely zoned out of the conversation and started scrolling through my phone. They couldn't see me directly, but they could tell I wasn't really listening. When they noticed, I felt super embarrassed and immediately apologized. I tried my best to stay off my phone for the rest of the conversation, but it was tough. The worst part was realizing how rude I had been to someone I care about. It was a wake-up call for me to be more present in my interactions.",

I couldn't believe how quickly false information spread and how many people believed it without checking the facts.

They were saying really mean stuff, like accusing the artist of plagiarizing and calling them bad musicians. It totally killed my vibe and made me feel awful. I just wanted to share my excitement, but instead, I ended up feeling really down because of all the negativity.",
    "scenario_3": "Recently, I had an interesting experience on social media, specifically on the app X, formerly known as Twitter. I'm a huge fan of a K-pop artist, and I was thrilled to hear about their upcoming music comeback. Excitedly, I made a post sharing the news and expressing my happiness. However, my excitement was dampened when I saw comments from non-fans and haters. They were saying hurtful things, accusing the artist of plagiarism and calling their music bad. This really upset me because I was just trying to share something I was passionate about. The negativity in the comments made the whole experience quite disheartening.",

It's like this weird buildup of nerves when I'm about to hit 'share' and open the app. After I post, I usually just push it from my mind and it's fine, but those few minutes before are the worst.

I decided to post one of the pics on my Instagram, and everyone in the photo had said it was okay to post. But then, one of my friends got really annoyed after I posted it. He suddenly thought he looked ugly in the photo, even though he had told me it was fine before. This turned into a big argument between us. I was super annoyed because he had given me permission, and it was just a small account with a few close followers. But he kept insisting I take it down, so I eventually did. The worst part was having a fight with a close friend over something that was supposed to be a fun memory of us having a good time.",
    "scenario_3": "Recently, I had a bit of a rough experience with social media that involved one of my close friends. We were all at a party and took some fun pictures of our friend group. Later, I decided to post a few of those pictures on my account, which has a small number of selected followers. I made sure to get everyone's permission before posting, and everyone, including one of my friends, said it was okay. However, once the post went live, that same friend got really annoyed because he thought he looked ugly in the photo, even though he had initially given me the green light to post it. This disagreement quickly escalated into an argument. I was frustrated because I had followed the proper steps by asking for permission, but he was upset and wanted me to take the post down. Despite my annoyance, I ended up removing the post. The worst part of the whole situation was having an argument with a close friend over a post that was meant to capture us having a good time together.",

Every time I try to take a break and scroll through TikTok, I'm bombarded with these posts that make me loathe my own features. It makes me feel deeply insecure and ashamed. But then I think about my home country and its rich, unique culture, and I desperately try to remind myself that beauty isn't one-size-fits-all. The worst part is, there's no escape. Even when I'm just trying to relax, there's always some post viciously comparing or hating on a specific feature. It's utterly exhausting and soul-crushing.",

Recently, I came across a tweet that really got under my skin: 'Don't marry a man who expects you to provide 50/50 and go to work.' This wasn't the first time this person had posted something like this; just last week, they had another tweet blow up with thousands of likes and retweets from big accounts. I guess they thought they could replicate that success, but this time it just came off as weird and out of touch. I couldn't stay silent, so I decided to voice my thoughts without revealing who I was. The whole situation was ridiculous to me. In today's world, it's almost impossible for a household to survive on a single income, especially with multiple people. Advice like this, if taken seriously, could ruin many healthy relationships where both partners are willing to make sacrifices for each other. It's just not realistic.",

This wasn't the first time this person had posted something like this; just last week, they had another similar tweet that went viral, getting thousands of likes and retweets from big accounts. I think that success went to their head, and they tried to replicate it, but this time it just came off as a strange and impractical remark. I felt compelled to respond, so I shared my thoughts without revealing my identity. The worst part for me was how ridiculous I found the advice. In today's world, it's nearly impossible for a household to survive on a single income, especially if there are multiple people involved.

The worst part is realizing how much time I've wasted\u2014time that I could have spent being more productive, like going to the gym or working on my hobbies. It's a tough balance to strike, and I'm constantly reminding myself to do better.",

They twisted my words to make me look bad and tried to turn my other friends against me. It was so messed up. I felt super isolated and anxious, like I was completely alone. I tried to handle it maturely by talking things out one-on-one with my friends instead of getting caught up in the group drama. But the worst part was that there was this awful period where no one would talk to me at all. I seriously thought I might never be able to fix things and come back from it.",
    "scenario_2": "So, I've been part of this online gaming community for a while now. I made some really good friends there, mostly from the US. Everything was going great until this one person, who I thought was a friend, started causing drama. They took things I had confided in them and twisted my words to make me look bad to my other friends. It was like they were trying to turn everyone against me. I felt so isolated and anxious, like I was completely alone. It was really tough because there was a period where no one would talk to me, and I honestly thought I couldn't come back from it. But instead of getting caught up in the drama, I decided to handle it maturely. I talked to each person individually and cleared things up. It was a rough patch, but I managed to sort things out without feeding into the group drama.",

I had known most of the group for quite a while before this new person joined. I thought they were a friend, but they started using things I told them in confidence to create drama and separate me from the rest of the group. They twisted my words to make me look bad, which really hurt. It made me feel isolated, alone, and super anxious. I tried to handle the situation maturely by addressing the issues one-on-one with the people involved, instead of getting caught up in the group's drama. But the worst part was that there was a period where no one would talk to me, and I felt like I couldn't recover from it. It was a really lonely and stressful time.",

    "scenario_1": "Recently, I had a really tough experience with social media that left me feeling pretty shaken. An acquaintance of mine posted a video of me without my knowledge or consent. The video was an inside joke within my friend group, something that only we would understand and find funny. Unfortunately, when it was shared online, people outside our circle saw it and didn't get the context. Instead, they found it crude and started criticizing me. This whole situation made me feel incredibly embarrassed and upset. It felt like a violation of my privacy, knowing that something meant for close friends was now out there for strangers to see. I was especially worried about other acquaintances seeing the video and forming a negative opinion of me based on it. When I confronted the acquaintance who posted it, I was upset but tried to be clear and direct about why it was wrong to share the video without my consent. The worst part was knowing that people who don't really know me might now have this crude and unfavorable impression of who I am. It was a really tough lesson about the importance of consent and privacy in the digital age.",
    "scenario_2": "So, something pretty embarrassing happened to me recently. An acquaintance posted a video of me online without me knowing. It was meant to be an inside joke within my friend group, but to anyone outside of it, it looked really crude and weird. The acquaintance thought it was funny, but it totally backfired and people started criticizing me. I felt super embarrassed and upset, and honestly, kind of violated because it was shared without my consent. It was really shameful thinking that strangers and other acquaintances would see this and have a bad first impression of me. I confronted the acquaintance and told them straight up why I was upset and that it was wrong to film me without asking. The worst part was knowing that people I barely know might see this and think badly of me. It was a really rough experience.",
    "scenario_3": "Recently, I had a pretty rough experience on social media. An acquaintance of mine posted a video of me without my knowledge. The video was an inside joke within my friend group, so to outsiders, it came off as crude and confusing. The acquaintance thought it was funny, but it totally backfired and led to people criticizing me. I felt super embarrassed and upset, like my privacy was violated. It was really shameful to think that this video was people's first impression of me, especially since it was meant to be a private joke among close friends. I confronted the acquaintance and told them why I was upset and that it was wrong to film me without my consent. The worst part was knowing that other acquaintances, who I wouldn't want to see this, might have watched the video. Plus, the negative comments made me feel like people had a really bad first impression of me.",
