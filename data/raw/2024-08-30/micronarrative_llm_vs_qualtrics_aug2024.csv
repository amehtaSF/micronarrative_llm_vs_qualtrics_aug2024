The purpose of this research is to better understand differences in methods of collecting data about people's experiences. You will be asked to write about experiences from your own life in conversation with an artificial-intelligence-powered chat bot and in Qualtrics web forms. You will then be asked to read different descriptions of that situation and rate different aspects of the descriptions. In addition, you may also be asked questions about general questions about yourself.

TIME INVOLVEMENT: Your participation will take approximately 30 minutes.



RISKS AND BENEFITS: This research imposes a minimal risk of emotional discomfort while describing negative situations. Study data will be stored securely, in compliance with Stanford University standards, minimizing the risk of confidentiality breach. We do not anticipate any benefits arising from this study. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study. Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your grades in school.

A group of people, who didn't even know her, started making horrible comments about her appearance. They said her features and body were disgusting and gross, and they picked on things like her nose and jaw for no reason at all. There wasn't any context or reason behind their cruelty; they just wanted to be mean. Seeing those comments made me feel disgusted and angry on her behalf. It was so emotional trying to help her through it because she got hurt really badly. The worst part was trying to make her feel better about herself, even though none of this was her fault. It was heartbreaking to see her in so much pain.",I had seen a friend on Instagram who was being bullied because of how they looked.
