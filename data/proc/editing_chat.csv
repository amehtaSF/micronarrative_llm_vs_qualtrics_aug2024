But then, out of nowhere, she started ghosting me. She wouldn't respond to my messages or even open them, yet I could see her being active online and hanging out with friends. This went on for weeks, and I felt numb and confused. I kept hoping things would get better, but it just left me feeling more and more frustrated.

6109ab5e542ae3f78f1d29dc,2024-09-06T02:48:48.582444,1,"Recently, I had a really tough experience with social media that left me feeling pretty shaken. An acquaintance of mine posted a video of me without my knowledge or consent. The video was an inside joke within my friend group, something that only we would understand and find funny. Unfortunately, when it was shared online, people outside our circle saw it and didn't get the context. Instead, they found it crude and started criticizing me. This whole situation made me feel incredibly embarrassed and upset. It felt like a violation of my privacy, knowing that something meant for close friends was now out there for strangers to see. I was especially worried about other acquaintances seeing the video and forming a negative opinion of me based on it. When I confronted the acquaintance who posted it, I was upset but tried to be clear and direct about why it was wrong to share the video without my consent. The worst part was knowing that people who don't really know me might now have this crude and unfavorable impression of who I am. This experience highlighted the importance of always asking for permission before filming or sharing content involving others, emphasizing the need for respect and privacy in the digital age.",assistant
