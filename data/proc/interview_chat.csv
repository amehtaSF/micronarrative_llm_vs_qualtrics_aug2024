66b9c708fc867a3d4e7208c4,2024-09-03T12:02:32.115363,1,"Great question! By ""social media,"" I mean any online platform where you interact with others, like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitter, Facebook, or even messaging apps like WhatsApp. A challenging experience could be anything that made you feel uncomfortable, upset, or stressed. This could include things like cyberbullying, feeling left out, receiving negative comments, or even just feeling overwhelmed by the amount of time spent online.

Does that help clarify things? If so, let's start with the first question:

I had a habit of saying outrageous things simply for shock value and ignoring people’s boundaries for the sake of that.

It’s hard to think about it this way but there were many times when it veered into sexual harassment. After a while I was just focused on trying not to repeat the same mistakes.

Even worse is that they lied about what I did, I guess to exaggerate or something, which I genuinely don’t understand the reasons for because from my perspective the real truth was actually worse than the lie this person told",human
