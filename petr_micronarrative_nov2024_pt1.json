While scrolling through my feed, I stumbled upon some really distressing images of people who have lost their lives in war zones. It was unexpected and hit me hard. Seeing those images made me feel incredibly sad and lonely, like I was carrying a heavy weight that I couldn't shake off. The worst part was this overwhelming sense of helplessness, knowing that there's so little I can do to change such heartbreaking situations. It's been tough to process these emotions, and I'm trying to find a way to cope with them.",

One day, she posted this amazing vacation photo, but then she started comparing herself to all these influencers. It hit her hard how bad this constant comparing was for her mental health. So, she decided to take a break from social media to focus on herself. When she came back, she made a big change. Instead of just posting the 'perfect' stuff, she started sharing real moments from her life. She wanted to be honest and help her followers feel okay about being themselves too. But before all this, she was really struggling. Scrolling through her feed made her feel so overwhelmed and not good enough. She'd see everyone's 'perfect' lives and think, 'Why isn't my life like that?' It was super tough, and it even brought her to tears one night. That's when she knew she had to step back and take care of her own mental health. Now, she's all about being real and embracing who she truly is.",

It's like I can't stop myself, and it makes me feel out of control and kind of stupid. The worst part is feeling so helpless, like I can't break the cycle. It's frustrating because I know I should be sleeping, but the app just keeps pulling me back in. I really need to figure out a way to manage my time better and not let TikTok take over my nights.",
