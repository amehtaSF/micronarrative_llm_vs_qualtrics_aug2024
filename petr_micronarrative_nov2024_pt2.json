This is the story you shared with me previously -- let's reflect on it together. \n \n Lately, I've been feeling pretty down because of stuff I see online. My friend posted about Trump, and honestly, I think he sucks. Seeing their posts about him just makes me feel sad. It's like every time I scroll through my feed, there's something from them about him that just brings me down. The worst part is how sad it makes me feel, like a cloud hanging over my day. I guess I need to find a way to avoid those posts or maybe take a break from social media for a bit.Let me know when you're ready!"
